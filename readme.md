# pySourceSimulation
## Overview
A Python-based simulation tool for analyzing and visualizing phase-related data and signals.
This web-app has been designed for my brother to help him preparing his sound system placement and tuning. All the backend has been entirely developped by me and shiny python was used for the UI. 
This tools help analysing source radiation and source interaction in a free field condition. It provide a parametric field visualisation interface, multiple elementary radiation source.
The project is still in its early phase and this version is just an Alpha, lot of new feature will be added with time, if you have any idea for improvement, please let me know.
It has been designed to be user friendly and don't require any coding (for now -- might add some advanced tweaking function which will require coding).



## Features
### Current features

- **Field visualisation** :
  - observing radiation of a source.
  - interaction between sources.
  - hover the mouse above a source give some information about it.
  - the pressure in dB SPL is displayed when hovering the mouse on the graphs.

- **Field Control**:
  - Choosing the frequency of interest -> the graph update acordingly
  - Choosing the size of the free field rendering (x,y)



- Timeline generation for sequential data visualization
- Stacked image plotting for comparing multiple datasets
- Interactive graph generation using Plotly
- Support for saving visualizations in various formats
### Future features
- **Field visualisation** :
  - Window for plot parameter
    -
